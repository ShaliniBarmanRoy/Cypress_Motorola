1. npm install----- When we tried to configure this project with component testing in Cypress UI after  executing npm install, the Cypress UI prompted to install 17th or less version for the below dependencies, as by default  after executing npm install , the 18th version of the mentioned dependencies got installed

@angular/cli
@angular-devkit/build-angular
@angular/core
@angular/common
@angular/platform-browser-dynamic

2. On installing 17th version, when I tried to run the component test script in Cypress UI, I got the below issue

The following error originated from your test code, not from Cypress.

> Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'None')

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.

Cypress could not associate this error to any specific test.

We dynamically generated a new test to display this failure.

3.Hence I have created a new package.json, with angular dependencies' version mentioned as "17.0.0", as we are unable to install the dependencies  with version 17.3.0
4. Even on extracting fresh project and executing "npm install"  under project path,  I am getting 17.0.0 version rather the version mentioned in package.json
4. Please let me know, if possible, what are the required dependencies' with version needed to run the component testing
